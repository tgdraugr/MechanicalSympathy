# Mechanical Sympathy

> _The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry._

The idea of this repository is to put into practice the teachings of Martin Thompson, on his blog "Mechanical Sympathy" (see [here](https://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/)). I want to achieve a deeper understanding of the underlying machine, enabling me to train techniques of debugging, benchmarking and profiling code, as well as achieving greater quality of the code developed (essencially, better designed, performant and efficient).
